Your approach of using multiple MongoDB databases for different projects in separate Python virtual environments is a good practice for project isolation. To address the path issue and accommodate your requirement, here are some strategies you can employ:

## 1. Use Project-Specific Data Directories

For each project, you can create a dedicated data directory within the project folder. This approach keeps your database files alongside your project files.

### Implementation:

1. In each project's root directory, create a `data` folder:

   ```sh
   mkdir data
   ```

2. When starting MongoDB for a specific project, use the `--dbpath` option:

   ```sh
   mongod --dbpath ./data
   ```

3. In your Python script or configuration, specify this path when connecting:

   ```python
   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017', directoryperdb=True)
   ```

   The `directoryperdb=True` option ensures each database gets its own subdirectory.

## 2. Use Environment Variables

Utilize environment variables to dynamically set the database path for each project.

### Implementation:

1. In your project's virtual environment, set an environment variable:

   ```sh
   export MONGODB_DATA_PATH="/path/to/your/project/data"
   ```

2. In your Python script, read this environment variable:

   ```python
   import os
   from pymongo import MongoClient

   db_path = os.getenv('MONGODB_DATA_PATH', '/default/path')
   client = MongoClient(f'mongodb://localhost:27017', directoryperdb=True)
   ```

3. When starting MongoDB:

   ```sh
   mongod --dbpath $MONGODB_DATA_PATH
   ```

## 3. Use Configuration Files

Create a separate MongoDB configuration file for each project.

### Implementation:

1. Create a `mongod.conf` file in each project:

   ```yaml
   storage:
     dbPath: /path/to/your/project/data
   ```

2. Start MongoDB using this configuration:

   ```sh
   mongod --config ./mongod.conf
   ```

## 4. Use Docker Containers

For complete isolation, consider using Docker containers for each project's MongoDB instance.

### Implementation:

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     mongodb:
       image: mongo:latest
       volumes:
         - ./data:/data/db
       ports:
         - "27017:27017"
   ```

2. Start MongoDB using Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## 5. Use Different Ports

Run multiple MongoDB instances on different ports.

### Implementation:

1. Start MongoDB instances with different ports:

   ```sh
   mongod --dbpath ./project1/data --port 27017
   mongod --dbpath ./project2/data --port 27018
   ```

2. In your Python script, connect to the specific port:

   ```python
   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017')  # For project 1
   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27018')  # For project 2
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Document Your Setup**: Keep a README in each project explaining how to set up and connect to its MongoDB instance.

2. **Use Virtual Environments**: Continue using virtual environments to isolate Python dependencies.

3. **Backup Regularly**: Implement a backup strategy for your project-specific databases.

4. **Version Control**: Consider versioning your database configurations, but not the data itself.

5. **Security**: Ensure proper access controls, especially if running multiple instances.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage multiple MongoDB databases for different projects while maintaining isolation and organization. Choose the method that best fits your workflow and project requirements.
